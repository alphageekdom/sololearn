The Batman film series has had plenty of ups and downs over the years. 
Older fans might push for Tim Burton's 1989 film or maybe its sequel as personal favorites,
while the next generation usually claims Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight
as a high water mark. But no matter the end result, we at least want "the next one"
to be great. Batman the character, or at least the guy playing him, is another matter entirely:
these actors are typically met by a tidal wave of fan backlash, even though most ultimately
redeemed themselves. (Ironically, one of the only actors not immediately balked at looked
like this four months before signing on.) Robert Pattinson was no exception:
Twilight may be a distant memory now, but even his head-turning roles in Cosmopolis,
Maps to the Stars, The Lighthouse, and other more recent films couldn't prevent knee-jerk
Edward Cullen jokes. While Pattinson isn't the best part of Matt Reeves' The Batman,
he at least solidly anchors a film more concerned with tone and atmosphere than air-tight storytelling.
